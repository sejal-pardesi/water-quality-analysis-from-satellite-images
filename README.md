Qualitative water quality analysis from Sentinel-2A images for Indian sub-continental regionðŸ“Š

Remote sensing has proven to be an efficient tool for monitoring water quality due to characteristics such as high coverage and less time consuming. Because of its capacity to capture the possible association between water quality metrics and satellite imagery, machine learning has increasingly been applied for water quality retrieval. This project focuses on the usage of Sentinel-2 images for qualitative water quality analysis of four different saline water bodies â€“ Arabian sea, Bay of Bengal, Lonar lake and Arabian sea near the southern coastal region of Indian subcontinent. The proposed work calculates normalized difference chlorophyll, turbidity and salinity index and classifies the water quality using ML classification algorithms. The project also performs comparative analysis of five different classification algorithms: Random Forest, K nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. According to the results, Random Forest outperformed the other four algorithms with 94% accuracy in classifying the water quality into good or poor category. The key findings demonstrates that Bay of Bengal region is comparatively less contaminated and saline as compared to the Arabian sea and Lonar lake which shows high amount of salinity and chlorophyll-a concentration ranging from 25 to 30 mg m-3.
